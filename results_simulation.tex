\subsection{Simulation}
We have introduced this projected gamma distribution existing on $\mathcal{S}_{\infty}^{p-1}$.  As a
  means of evaluating how well we can recover a distribution under the proposed model, we have
  generated a series of datasets on $\mathcal{S}_{\infty}^{d-1}$, for $d$ ranging between 3 and 20.
  We generated each dataset from a mixture of projected Gammas, with the number of mixture components
  ranging between 3 and 12.  The generation procedure is detailed in Algorithm~\ref{algo:simulated}.
  \begin{algorithm}[htb]
    \For{$n_{\text{mix}}$ in $[3, 6, 9, 12]$}{
      Generate $n_{\text{mix}} \times 20$ shape Parameters $\alpha$\\
      Generate $n_{\text{mix}} \times 20$ Rate Parameters $\beta$\\
      Generate $500$ Mixture Component Identifiers $\delta$\\
      \For{$i$ in $1,\ldots,500$}{
        Generate ${\bf X}_i \sim \prod_{l = 1}^d\text{Ga}\left(X_{il}\mid\alpha_{\delta_i,l},\beta_{\delta_i, l}\right)$
        }
      \For{$n_{\text{col}}$ in $[3,6,12,20]$}{
        Project columns 1 to $n_{\text{col}}$ of ${\bf X}$ onto $\mathcal{S}_{\infty}^{n_{\text{col}} - 1}$ and save.
        }
    }
    \caption{Simulated Angular Dataset Generation Routine\label{algo:simulated}}
  \end{algorithm}
  The choice of generation routine for $\alpha = \alpha_0 + \alpha_1$ where
  $\alpha_0 \sim \text{Unif}(\alpha_0\mid 0,4)$, $\alpha_1\sim \text{Gamma}(\alpha_1\mid 1,1)$.
  The choice of generation routine for $\beta$ is $\beta\sim\text{Unif}(\beta\mid 0.25, 2.5)$.
  This choice was made to ensure that $\beta$ does not approach 0 in the generation routine.

In Figure~\ref{fig:simes}, we fit DP Mixtures of the various models presented and plot the resulting
  energy score against the number of columns, grouped by the number of mixture components used in
  dataset generation.  The \emph{Generative} model refers to a dataset generated
  in the same manner, from the same parameters as was used to create the original dataset.  Against
  this generative dataset, we compare DP Mixtures of projected gamma, projected restricted gamma, and
  projected restricted gamma with a multivariate log-normal prior.  We observe that the projected
  restricted Gamma model dominates in most situations, but the difference between projected restricted
  Gamma and the other gamma-based models tends to shrink as the number of columns increases.
  Alternatively, that difference appears to grow as the number of mixture components increases.

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \caption{Simulation Posterior Predictive Loss versus Column Count, by Mixture Component Count.\label{fig:simppl}}

  \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{./images/simulation_ppl}
\end{figure}

The posterior predictive loss criterion in Figure~\ref{fig:simppl} tells a similar story: the base
  model is inadequate for describing a mixture; and the DP mixture of projected restricted gammas
  performs the best of the presented models in most cases.  Interestingly, under both metrics we see
  the probit-normal model has the best performance when the number of columns is low.  That is
  unexpected behavior, as its performance very quickly degrades as the number of columns increases.

We frequently see all of the gamma-based mixture models accomplish a lower energy score than the generative
  distribution.  As \cite{nunez2019} noted, the projected Gamma model is very flexible and can generate
  multimodal distributions from a single mixture component.  When we allow a mixture model, we allow
  the possibility to break those modes into two different mixture components.  This will tend to
  result in a better energy score, as posterior predictive replicates for a given observation in a local
  model will tend to be concentrate in that local mode rather than being spread between multiple
  modes.  As for the dominance of projected restricted Gamma, By specifying $\beta_l := 1$ for all
  $l$, if there were multi-modal mixture components, we are in effect breaking the mixture components into separate modes. As for whether this represents \emph{overfitting}, If we had reason to
  believe that the generative distribution for real data followed this form, then such a case could
  be made.  However, we are using projected Gamma as a parametric stand-in for an unknown distribution.
  In this sense, the argument for overfitting is less clear.

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \caption{Estimated $k$NN-KL Divergence metric on simulated data, averaged between 1 and 10 nearest
    neighbors, against column count, for selected models.  Graphs are facetted according to the
    number of mixture components in the generating distribution.  The \emph{generative} model
    represents another replicate of the underlying distribution, so that should be regarded as
    \emph{truth}.\label{fig:simkld}}
  \includegraphics[width = 5.5in, height = 3.75in]{./images/simulation_knn_kld}
\end{figure}

in Figure~\ref{fig:simkld} we see the application of the $k$NN-based K.L. divergence metric detailed
  in Equation~\ref{eqn:knnkld} to the simulated data sets.  For display, this metric has been averaged
  between $1$ and $10$ neighbors.  In general, the K.L. divergence metric is a log-ratio
  of densities, integrated over the entire space.  In this fashion, we should interpret that model
  is \emph{best} that stays closest to 0, as that indicates the two densities are equivalent.  The
  equation also includes a scaling factor for the size of the data sets, as all else being equal, a
  larger data set will decrease the distance between any point and its neighbors.  We can regard the
  \emph{generative} model as another replicate data set from the generating distribution--another
  view of truth.  As its distribution should be almost identical, we would assume that the KL divergence
  metric from this model will come closest to 0.  It does not.  Knowing this to be the case, we should
  instead regard the generative model as truth, and treat as best the model which comes closest to the
  \emph{generative} model.  In this regard, we observe that the projected gamma model comes closest,
  with the projected restricted gamma model following behind.  The probit-normal model quickly diverges
  as the number of dimensions increases.  This is not unexpected, as we saw similar behavior in the
  energy score and posterior predictive loss criteria.
