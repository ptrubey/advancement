\subsection{Simulation}
We have introduced this projected gamma distribution existing on $\mathcal{S}_{\infty}^{p-1}$.  As a
  means of evaluating how well we can recover a distribution under the proposed model, we have
  generated a series of datasets on $\mathcal{S}_{\infty}^{d-1}$, for $d$ ranging between 3 and 20.
  We generated each dataset from a mixture of projected Gammas, with the number of mixture components
  ranging between 3 and 12.  The generation procedure is detailed in Algorithm~\ref{algo:simulated}.
  \begin{algorithm}[H]
    \label{algo:simulated}
    % \setAlgoLined
    \For{$n_{\text{mix}}$ in $[3, 6, 9, 12]$}{
      Generate $n_{\text{mix}} \times 20$ shape Parameters $\alpha$\\
      Generate $n_{\text{mix}} \times 20$ Rate Parameters $\beta$\\
      Generate $500$ Mixture Component Identifiers $\delta$\\
      \For{$i$ in $1,\ldots,500$}{
        Generate ${\bf X}_i \sim \prod_{l = 1}^d\text{Ga}\left(X_{il}\mid\alpha_{\delta_i,l},\beta_{\delta_i, l}\right)$
        }
      \For{$n_{\text{col}}$ in $[3,6,12,20]$}{
        Project columns 1 to $n_{\text{col}}$ of ${\bf X}$ onto $\mathcal{S}_{\infty}^{n_{\text{col}} - 1}$ and save.
        }
    }
    \caption{Simulated Angular Dataset Generation Routine}
  \end{algorithm}
  The choice of generation routine for $\alpha = \alpha_0 + \alpha_1$ where
  $\alpha_0 \sim \text{Unif}(\alpha_0\mid 0,4)$, $\alpha_1\sim \text{Gamma}(\alpha_1\mid 1,1)$.
  The choice of generation routine for $\beta$ is $\beta\sim\text{Unif}(\beta\mid 0.25, 2.5)$.
  This choice was made to ensure that $\beta$ does not approach 0 in the generation routine.

Our presented model, along with a couple comparative models is presented in Table~\makenote{still to do}.
  Interestingly, the performance of the restricted Gamma model seems to be better across the board.
