\section{Results}

\subsection{IVT - 8 Cells}
We use data from the integrated water vapor transport (\emph{IVT}) model\makenote{needs citation}
  of atmospheric rivers as a means of testing these models.  An atmospheric river is a meteorological
  event of local concentration of water vapor in the atmosphere that moves with wind patterns.
  Understanding dependence among extreme events in atmospheric rivers \makenote{finish thought}.

We observe

We compare these values against the intrinsic energy score for the 8 cell IVT dataset, approximately
  $0.796$.  Note that the vanilla models have a slightly higher energy score, subtly indicating a
  data structure that is unaccounted for by a single distribution.  The mixture models overall do
  better, though the restricted gamma based mixture models do significantly better than the
  unrestricted models.

\subsection{IVT - 46 Cells}

\include{table_dev_updated}
We compare these values against the intrinsic energy score for the 46 cell IVT dataset, approximately
  $1.428$.  Again, as with the 8 cell dataset, vanilla models show a worse result than the intrinsic
  energy score, indicating a model structure requiring a mixture approach.  In comparison to the
  8 cell data, where the log-normal prior models performed comparably or worse across the board to
  their
