In recent years much work has been done in exploring the definition and properties of an appropriate
  generalization of the univaraite generalized Pareto distribution for threshold exceedences to a
  multivariate setting.  This paper builds on the constructive definition of the multivariate Pareto
  presented in \cite{ferreira2014} that decomposes the vector of interest into independent radial and
  angular components; the latter supported on a particular manifold and containing only information
  relevant to the dependence structure of the distribution.  We motivate our analysis with a discussion
  of extreme analysis applications in atmospheric sciences, in particular using the integrated vapor
  transport (IVT) data for assessing atmospheric rivers.

In this paper, we propose a novel approach to parameterize this dependence structure and conduct
  inference upon it.  We then explore some opportunities afforded to us by a parametrically modelled
  dependence structure in classical multivariate extreme analysis.  Finally, we explore the efficacy
  of some anomaly detection methods made possible by the existence of such a distribution, adapted
  to the support of the angular component.
  \bruno{You have to make the abstract sound more like the abstract for the advacement and less the abstract for a paper. Group the material that you are discussion into three broad projects.}

\makenote{Extend the abstract.  Highlight the importance of EVT as a tool to predict behavior of
    tails of a distribution.  Also talk about applications considered, and computational challenges. }
