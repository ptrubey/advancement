Atmospheric rivers contribute greatly to precipitation and downstream effects in a region.
  With tools from Extreme Value Theory, we transform and standardize data as coming from a
  Simple Pareto Process.  Then relying on the homogeneity property of the simple Pareto process,
  we factor the data into its radial and angular components, then introduce a distribution ideally
  suited for the study of this angular component.  We compare model performance for this distribution
  against other distributions defined on a similar space.  Finally, we explore various inferences
  that can be made from this distribution.
