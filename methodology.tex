\section{Methodology}
\label{sec:methodology}
To establish a distribution on this extremal dependence structure, first we must standardize $\bm{X} \in R^d$
  such that its marginal extreme distributions follow a common form.  Following the work of
  \cite{ferreira2014}, if the marginal distributions $F_{l}$ fall into the domain
  of attraction of some GEV $G_l$, then threshold exceedences for a sufficiently high threshold $b_{l}$
  can be modelled as generalized Pareto $H_l$.  Standardization--transforming threshold exceedences to
  standard Pareto--occurs as
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eqn:standardization}
    Z_l = \left(1 + \xi_l\frac{X_l - b_{t,l}}{a_{t,l}}\right)_{+}^{1/\xi_l}
  \end{equation}
  where $(\cdot)_{+}$ indicates not less than 0. If the quantity inside is less than 0, then the value
  is truncated at 0.  We begin this transformation by establishing the
  marginal thresholds $b_{t,l} := \hat{F}_l^{-1}\left(1 - \frac{1}{t}\right)$, then for those observations
  in excess of the marginal threshold, we fit the scale parameters $a_{t,l}$, and extremal index $\xi_l$
  via maximum likelihood. Note that $z_l > 1$ implies that $x_l > b_{t,l}$, meaning that the observation
  $\bm{x}$ is extreme in the $l$'th dimension.  Note also that $\sup_j Z_j$ follows a simple Pareto
  distribution. Fitting of the marginal extremal index and scale parameters uses only observations in
  excess of the marginal threshold. Following standardization, further analysis is conditional on
  $R \geq 1$.

After standardization and transformation, we have $R\sim\text{Pareto}(1)$, and, independently,
  $\bm{V}\in\mathcal{S}_{\infty}^{d-1}$, the positive orthant of the unit hypersphere under the
  $\mathcal{L}_{\infty}$ norm.  The distribution of $\bm{V}$ effectively describes the dependence
  structure of $\bm{Z}$, so the goal of our analysis subsequently becomes to adequately describe the
  distribution of $\bm{V}$.  We are as yet unaware of any known distributions established with a support
  natively in this space, so we propose projecting a distribution defined on $\mathcal{R}_{+}^{d}$ onto
  $\mathcal{S}_{\infty}^{d-1}$, the unit hypersphere established under the $\mathcal{L}_{\infty}$ norm.
