\section{Methodology}

After standardization and transformation, we are left with $R\sim\text{Pareto}(1)$, and, independently,
  ${\bf V}\in\mathcal{S}_{\infty}^{d-1}$, the positive orthant of the hypersphere under the
  $\mathcal{L}_{\infty}$ norm.  This distribution of ${\bf V}$ effectively describes the dependence
  structure of ${\bf Z}$, so establishing a distribution on ${\bf V}$ becomes the goal of our analysis.
  We are as yet unaware of any known distributions established on this support, so we propose projecting
  a distribution on $\mathcal{R}_{+}^{d}$ onto $\mathcal{S}_{\infty}^{d-1}$.

\subsection{Spatial Threshold Modeling}
Following the work of \cite{ferreira2014}, any of the above methods can be
  extended to the spatial domain by modification of the marginalization process.
  Assume a spatial process $X({\bf s})$, ${\bf s}\in {\bf S}$.  Then take the
  transformation
\begin{equation}
  \label{eqn:spatial}
  Z({\bf s}) = \left(1 + \gamma({\bf s})\frac{X({\bf s}) - b_t({\bf s})}{a_t({\bf s})}\right)_{+}^{1/{\gamma({\bf s})}}
\end{equation}
  where $b_t({\bf s})$ is a function corresponding to a high threshold at location
  ${\bf s}$, analogous to the role $b_t$ played previously. $a_t({\bf s})$
  corresponds to a scaling function, and $\gamma({\bf s})$ an extremal value index
  function.
