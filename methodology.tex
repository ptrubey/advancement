\section{Methodology}
Assuming that $X_j$ is in the domain of attraction of a max stable distribution
  for each $j$, then the standardization of $X$ to GPD process occurs as follows:

\begin{equation}
Z_{j} = \left(1 + \gamma_j\frac{X_{j} - b_{tj}}{a_{tj}}\right)_{+}^{1/\gamma_j}
\end{equation}
where $b_{tj} = F^{-1}(1-1/t)$, and $a_{tj}$ and $\gamma_{j}$ are evaluated via
  maximum likelihood \makenote{(need to fix)}.  The quantity
  $\left(1 + \gamma_j\frac{X_{j} - b_{tj}}{a_{tj}}\right)_+$ is left truncated
  at 0.  Note that $Z_j > 1$ indicates that $X_{j} > b_{tj}$, meaning that the
  observation was \emph{extreme} in that dimension.  Recognize here that $Z_i$
  exists on the positive orthant in Euclidean space, $\mathcal{R}_+^d$, and
  that $\max_jZ_j$ follows a simple Pareto distribution.  Additionally, we can
  transform ${\bf Z} \rightarrow (R, {\bf V})$, where:
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    R &= \lVert {\bf z} \rVert_{\infty} = \max_{j \in (1,\ldots,d)} z_i\\
    {\bf V} &= \left(\frac{z_1}{R},\ldots,\frac{z_d}{R}\right) \in S_{\infty}^{d-1}.\\
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

Thus ${\bf V}$ is the projection of the ${\bf Z}$ vector onto the unit
  hypersphere, using the $L_{\infty}$ norm.  As stated before by homogeneity
  property, a spectral measure $\Phi$ on some space in $S_{\infty}^{d-1}$ is
  independent of $R$, which follows the standard Pareto distribution by
  construction.

We are interested in the angular distribution of ${\bf V}$, the projection of
  the standardized observations ${\bf Z}$ onto the unit hypersphere. To
  construct a parametric model on that angular distribution, we employ the
  projected gamma distribution.

\subsection{Spatial Threshold Modeling}
Following the work of \cite{ferreira2014}, any of the above methods can be
  extended to the spatial domain by modification of the marginalization process.
  Assume a spatial process $X({\bf s})$, ${\bf s}\in {\bf S}$.  Then take the
  transformation
\begin{equation}
  \label{eqn:spatial}
  Z({\bf s}) = \left(1 + \gamma({\bf s})\frac{X({\bf s}) - b_t({\bf s})}{a_t({\bf s})}\right)_{+}^{1/{\gamma({\bf s})}}
\end{equation}
  where $b_t({\bf s})$ is a function corresponding to a high threshold at location
  ${\bf s}$, analogous to the role $b_t$ played previously. $a_t({\bf s})$
  corresponds to a scaling function, and $\gamma({\bf s})$ an extremal value index
  function.
