\section{Methodology}
To establish a distribution on this extremal dependence structure, first we must standardize ${\bf X} \in R^d$
  such that its marginal extreme distributions follow a common form.  Following the work of
  \cite{ferreira2014}, if the marginal distributions $F_{l}$ fall into the domain
  of attraction of some GEV $G_l$, then threshold exceedences for a sufficiently high threshold $b_{l}$
  can be modelled as generalized Pareto $H_l$.  Standardization--transforming threshold exceedences to
  standard Pareto--occurs as
  \begin{equation}
    Z_l = \left(1 + \xi_l\frac{X_l - b_{t,l}}{a_{t,l}}\right)_{+}^{1/\xi_l}.
  \end{equation}
  We establish the marginal thresholds $b_{t,l} := \hat{F}_l^{-1}\left(1 - \frac{1}{l}\right)$,
  then fit the scale parameters $a_{t,l}$, and extremal index $\xi_l$ via maximum likelihood.
  Note that $z_l > 1$ implies that $x_l > b_{t,l}$, meaning that the observation ${\bf x}$ is
  extreme in the $l$'th dimension.  Note also that $\sup_j Z_j$ follows a simple Pareto distribution.
  Fitting of the marginal extremal index and scale parameters uses only observations in excess of the
  marginal threshold. Following standardization, further analysis is conditioned on $R \geq 1$.

After standardization and transformation, we are left with $R\sim\text{Pareto}(1)$, and, independently,
  ${\bf V}\in\mathcal{S}_{\infty}^{d-1}$, the positive orthant of the hypersphere under the
  $\mathcal{L}_{\infty}$ norm.  This distribution of ${\bf V}$ effectively describes the dependence
  structure of ${\bf Z}$, so establishing a distribution on ${\bf V}$ becomes the goal of our analysis.
  We are as yet unaware of any known distributions established on this support, so we propose projecting
  a distribution on $\mathcal{R}_{+}^{d}$ onto $\mathcal{S}_{\infty}^{d-1}$, the unit hypersphere
  established under the $\mathcal{L}_{\infty}$ norm.

\subsection{Spatial Threshold Modeling}
Following the work of \cite{ferreira2014}, any of the above methods can be
  extended to the spatial domain by modification of the marginalization process.
  Assume a spatial process $X({\bf s})$, ${\bf s}\in {\bf S}$.  Then take the
  transformation
\begin{equation}
  \label{eqn:spatial}
  Z({\bf s}) = \left(1 + \gamma({\bf s})\frac{X({\bf s}) - b_t({\bf s})}{a_t({\bf s})}\right)_{+}^{1/{\gamma({\bf s})}}
\end{equation}
  where $b_t({\bf s})$ is a function corresponding to a high threshold at location
  ${\bf s}$, analogous to the role $b_t$ played previously. $a_t({\bf s})$
  corresponds to a scaling function, and $\gamma({\bf s})$ an extremal value index
  function.
